I have authored or co-authored projects on Github, including these selected public repositories:

[`strym`](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/strym): A python package for real-time CAN data logging, analysis and visualization. [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/strym)](https://pepy.tech/project/strym)

[`can_to_ros`](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/can_to_ros): A ROS package that decodes, publishes, and records vehicle network (CAN, CAN FD, etc.) messages in real time. Also used to inject control commands to vehicles. Uses model-based code generation to dynamically be modified/updated via VIN, currently tested with 4 different OEMs.

[`libpanda`](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/libpanda): A C++ library that handles communication with microprocessors/vehicles. My contributions focus on applications (automated software updates, health monitors, etc.)
