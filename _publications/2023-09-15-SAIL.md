This work demonstrates a new capability in roadway control: Speed-adaptive, infrastructure-linked connected and automated vehicles. We develop and deploy a lightly modified vehicle that is able to dynamically adjust the vehicle speed in response to posted variable speed limit messages generated by the infrastructure using LTE connectivity. This work describes the open source hardware and software platform that enables integration between infrastructure-based variable posted speed limits, and existing vehicle platforms for automated control. The vehicle is deployed in heavy morning traffic on I-24 in Nashville, TN. The control vehicle follows the posted variable speed limits, resulting in as much as a 25% reduction in speed variability compared to a human-piloted vehicle in the same traffic stream.
