#The Story

My mom enjoys decorating the house with her (and family members') photography and artwork.I had never been included as a contributor to the collection until this effort. I set out to create a laser cut image of this particular tree on the Tulane campus because it is a quintessential southern oak. They cover the Tulane campus and they are beautiful.
