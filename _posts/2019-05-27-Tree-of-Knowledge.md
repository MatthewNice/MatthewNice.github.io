# The Story

My mom enjoys decorating the house with her (and family members') photography and artwork. I had never been included as a contributor to the collection until this effort. I set out to create a laser cut image of this particular tree on the Tulane campus because it is a quintessential southern oak. They cover the Tulane campus and they are beautiful.

The image was rastered into cardboard and MDF using an AutoCAD DWG file. First it was cut into cardboard as a test of feasability, then later cut larger onto MDF with a title and my name. Now it sits on a stand at home!
