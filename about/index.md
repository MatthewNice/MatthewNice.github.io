# Biography

I am a PhD student in Cyber Physical Systems at Vanderbilt University researching technology in transportation systems with [Professor Daniel Work](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/danwork/). I earned my B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Tulane University in New Orleans, where I graduated with honors from the Tulane Honors Program and was awarded the Senior Honors Scholar for highest scholarly achievement of my major. I earned my Master's in Cyber Physical Systems at Vanderbilt at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems.

## Research

My undergraduate research focused on microvasculature, angiogenesis more specifically. First, I worked on understanding the effective differences between different types of stem cells in their application for blood vessel growth in a Rat Mesentery Culture Model.  Then, for my thesis I undertook a project to take the model from rat into mouse. Taking the model into mice opened up the door for using genetic studies and CRISPR technology that wasn't possible in a rat model. This means, for example, 2x the number of cell types can be tracked and there can be temporal induction of genetic expression (e.g. flourescence, disease).

My graduate research has focused on collecting and deciphering the messages off of the CAN bus on commercial vehicles. By unlocking this data, I have been enabled a 10x reduction in experimental costs, and opened up new avenues of research for the Work Lab. See my [research page]({{ site.url }}/research/) for more on this.


## Career Interests
My career interests focus on the application of advanced computational techniques (e.g. big data analytics, machine learning, optimization) to systems anchored to the physical world (e.g. transporation systems, ecosystems, sensor networks).  I have applied these interests in my Master of Engineering project by reverse engineering the CAN bus on cars with use of information theory and data analytics in Python.

Generally I believe that knowledge, or development of a project, follows the shape of the curve above. I relish opportunities to work in an environment in the middle where I can start with the basics already known, "20% knowledge", and deliver substantial progress, "80% knowledge".

## Hobbies
In my free time I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee with the Nashville Trash Pandas, laser cutting, jogging, and gelato. See my [blog posts]({{ site.url }}/chronposts/) for some more info on my projects. I have a puppy Roux who enjoys jogging with me (still working on catching a frisbee).
