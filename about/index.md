# Biography

I am a masters student in Cyber Physical Systems at Vanderbilt University researching transportation systems with [Professor Daniel Work](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/danwork/). I earned my B.S.E in Biomedical Engineering from Tulane University in New Orleans, where I graduated with honors from the Tulane Honors Program and was awarded the Senior Honors Scholar for highest scholarly achievement of my major.

In my free time I enjoy ultimate frisbee, laser cutting, jogging, and beer tasting. See my [blog posts]({{ site.url }}/chronposts/) for some of my personal projects. I have a puppy Roux who enjoys jogging with me (still working on catching a frisbee).
